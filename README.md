# Binary Search Tree
This is an implementation of a basic Binary Search Tree.

### What is a Binary Search Tree?
A binary search tree is a rooted binary tree, whose internal nodes each store a key (and optionally, an associated value), and each has two distinguished sub-trees, commonly denoted left and right. The tree additionally satisfies the binary search property: the key in each node is greater than or equal to any key stored in the left sub-tree, and less than or equal to any key stored in the right sub-tree.

### Why use a Binary Search Tree?
Searching is very efficient in the tree, since we get eliminate half of the remaining elements at each step.

### This Binary Tree can
- Create a Binary Tree from a sorted array of elements
- Find and element inside the Tree
- Insert into the Tree, while keeping the minimum height
- Delete from the Tree and reordering elements below the deleted one
- Create an Array from the Binary Tree

### Parts of this project
- Main: It is used to test the functionality of the tree
- Node: It is the Node the tree builds upon
- BinarySearchTree: The implementation of the tree
